          <p>Ratanakiri or Ratanak Kiri (Khmer: រតនគិរី), is a province of northeast Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Mondulkiri to the south and Stung Treng to the west and the countries of Laos and Vietnam to the north and east, respectively. The province extends from the mountains of the Annamite Range in the north, across a hilly plateau between the Tonle San and Tonle Srepok rivers, to tropical deciduous forests in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have scarred Ratanakiri's environment, long known for its beauty.For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland Khmer Loeu people, who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the region's early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves by neighboring empires. The slave trade economy ended during the French colonial era, but a harsh Khmerization campaign after Cambodia's independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life. The Khmer Rouge built its headquarters in the province in the 1960s, and bombing during the Vietnam War devastated the region. Today, rapid development in the province is altering traditional ways of life. </p>

The situation from above is a small canal which continuously flows through the broken rocks, then to the stream below in 25-kilometer height. To view the waterfall, we should go down to the stream below where we have seen a big rocky cave with plain roof. At the bottom of the stream, there are many big rocks used as the seats for viewing the great and interesting water falling down from the mountaintop.<img src="images/attraction-Cha-Ong-Waterfall-4.jpg" alt="kingdom" style="width: 785px;height: 450"></p>

These can be organized by the lodges you are staying in.We went to see 3 waterfalls in total, visiting Ka Tieng, Kinchaan and Chaa Ong. To get to Ka Tieng. we had to go through a small river with the bike, which was pretty nerve racking, but worth the effort. On to Kinchaan, where we met some local guys keen to show off their cliff jumping skills, although i was happy to remain dry after my last cliff jumping experience ended in hospitalisation, with a torn medial knee ligament. I was happier to get wet at Chaa Ong, where Julia and I took a dip in the powerful spray dropping around 10 metres. We headed back to Ban Lung at sunset, impressed by the waterfalls and happy i had coped on the motorbike.Ka Tieng waterfall is located in Labang I commune, Lum Phat district, about 7 kilometers southeast of Ban Loung provincial town. Ka Tieng is below Ka Chanh waterfall and about 3 kilometers from it.<img src="images/kat.png" alt="kingdom" style="width: 785px;height: 450"> </p>

            <p>Located about 40km from northern part of the capital town of Banlung, the Se San is an all seasons river and one of the most important ecology systems that overlaps the provinces of Stung Treng and Ratanakiri. On the surface, some stretches of water glitter like diamonds and emeralds with white sandy beaches running alongside attracting scores of tourists to sunbath and make merry. The clear water along the river reflects the colourful sky-backed mountains and jungle and even during the dry season, the ambience can be charming. The numerous stretches of beach boast many spots for swimming and fishing; such recreational activities attract both local and international tourists all year round.On one side of the Se San River the Veon Sai commune is a harmonious territory occupied by several ethnic groups; Khmer, Chinese, Kroeng, and Laotian people have been living there for generations. While the Chinese observe their own Chinese culture and traditional practices, the other groups also have their own ancestral practices to keep their identities. Here, they all communicate commonly in Chinese although all of them do speak Khmer and understood the Cambodian language well. The Hill Tribe, and people of Laotian ethnicity speak in their mother tongue among their own kind.Most of the people here are farmers, fishermen and local traders.<img src="images/b1.png" alt="kingdom" style="width: 785px;height: 450"></p>
