          <p>Koh Kong is the most southwestern province of Cambodia. It is one of the biggest provinces in the whole country with a alot of attractions spot undeveloped coastline and a mountainous, forested and largely inaccessible interior, which embraces part of the Cardamom Mountains, the biggest coherent rainforest of Southeast Asia. Its tourist attractions include abundant wildlife; big waterfalls and casinos on the border to Thailand, while an Export Processing Zone and new port facilities are being developed for international trade. </p>
          <h2>Koh Kong City at Night</h2>
          <p>Dragon Den is what you might call Koh Rong’s first proper “bar”. While the majority of venues simply offer somewhere to enjoy cold and cheap beers in some degree of comfort, the drinks menu here is much longer, boasting imported wheat beers and even their own microbrews.The prices are still pretty reasonable, with draught Five Men Fresh Beer from Sihanoukville available for just about US$1. You can find Dragon Den near the ferry terminal of Koh Tui Village.</p>

          <p>Police Beach is the nearest thing to Thailand’s famous Full Moon Party on Koh Phangan’s Haad Rin Beach, with the added bonus that the party is twice a week instead of once a month.The beach is just a short walk along the coast from Koh Tui Village, with entrance from about US$5 in advance or US$7.50 at the door (though prices are prone to rising during busy periods). The atmosphere and size of the party make it similar to what Koh Phangan was like when the parties there first got started, being much safer and more relaxed. </p>
            <h2>Excursions in the Province</h2>
          <h3><b>.</b>Khun Chhang Khun Phen</h3>
            <p>Khun Chhang Khun Phen stupa sits on a rock in the middle of the sea tributary, about 1 kilometer from the provincial town. The stupa is 4 meters high and made of concrete. Because the site is small-only 40 square meters, including the stupa-it can accommodate only 10 to 15 visitors at a time. The stupa is about 1 kilometer from the provincial town. Koh Kong residents worship there and often visit the site on national holidays and traditional festivals. Khun Chhang Khun Phen is related to a Khmer legend. Once upon a time, there was villager's daughter named Thim, who was loved by a man named Khun Chhang. Khun Chhang was bold-headed and not very handsome, but his family was rich.Thim, however, did not love Khun Chhang, they became engaged and Khun Chhang married her.She later betrayed her husband to love a commander named Khun Phen. When Khun Chhang learned of his wife's affair, he complained to the King. The King decided to cut Thim's body into two parts. After Thim died, Khun Chhang buried her at the same place where she was killed. Because he wanted her to be reincarnated, Khun Chhang put up a soul flag pole on the east bank of the stream, facing where Thim was buried. Then he built a stupa in memory of their love. Later, the west bank of the stream was named Chetdey (a stupa) village, and the east bank was named Dangtung (a flage pole) village.<img src="images/khun-chhang-khun-phen-stupa.jpg" alt="kingdom" style="width: 785px;height: 450"></p>
          <h3><b>.</b>Koh Kong Safari World</h3>  
            <p>Koh Kong Safari World in Koh Kong is a small zoological park with more than 800 animals from almost 100 species such as bears, ostriches, kangaroos, giraffes, tigers, dolphins, deer and several other species from around the world. There are also several animal shows such as crocodile-show, bird-show, orangutan-show or a dolphin-show in the mornings and afternoons.The animal theme park is great place for families and there is also a beach and a restaurant.   Koh Kong Safari World is located near the Koh Kong Resort just 500 meters from the border between Cambodia and Thailand at Cham Yeam/Had Lek. There is also a caterpillar train service running between the Koh Kong Resort and Safari World.Animal welfare may not be the primary consideration at Koh Kong Safari World, run by Koh Kong International Resort (the casino-hotel a few kilometres away at the border), but the Disneyesque gateway - in a style that Bavaria's mad King Ludwig II would have found irresistible -doesn't hint at anything sinister.The park has the usual zoo animals but it also puts on the sort of live-animal shows banned in most countries, with performances reminiscent of a 19th-century circus sideshow. Every morning, and into the early afternoon, birds ride tiny bicycles, orang-utans dressed up as boxers throw punches and a man puts his head inside a crocodile's mouth.<img src="images/safari_world_in_koh_kong_province_in_2007_creative_commons.jpg" alt="kingdom" style="width: 785px;height: 450"></p>
