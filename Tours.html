              <p>The Royal Palace of Cambodia is a complex of buildings, even though it is generally understood to be the royal abode of the King of Cambodia. The compound was the citadel of King Ponhea Yat (1393-1463) and rebuilt to its present state in 1886, when King Norodom (1834-1904) relocated the royal capital from Oudong to Phnom Penh. The buildings with beautiful towering spires are a great example of classic Khmer architecture found in Cambodia today.nside the palace grounds, the noises from the street are silenced by the high walls surrounding the compound. While tourists cannot enter the area of the royal abode, visitors can gain entry to the Throne Hall.

              <p>Yeak Laom Lake is located about 5 kilometers southeast of central Banlung. This beautiful lake is a crater formed after a volcanic eruption over 4000 years ago; the diameter of this lake is about 800 meters and it bears about 50 meters of clear water.At one end, there are two wooden platforms for tourists to view the lake up close, but some people cannot resist a dip to feel the warmth of the water for themselves.A path surrounds the lake, providing a leisurely track for trekking. A walk around the lake takes around forty minutes. Midway along the track, at the western end of the lake, there is a small visitor center which exhibits and sells local handicrafts such as musical instruments.</p>

              <p>The Bousra Waterfall is conveniently located in Pech Chenda District, 43 kilometers from Sen Monorom. It can be accessed by red soil road. The waterfall is one of the most interesting places for keen tourists. It is divided into three stages: First Stage: The waterfall has 15-meter diameter and 8-12-meter height in the rainy season and 10-15-meter height in the dry season. 
            Second Stage: The waterfall has 23-meter diameter and 15-20-meter height in the rainy season and 20-meter diameter and 18-25-meter height in the dry season. The second stage of the waterfall has 150-meter distance from the first stage.Third Stage: The waterfall has stronger speed than the second stage. This stage can not be reached because of its location in the thick forest and lack of means of transport.</p><a class="post-card__avatar6" href="post6.html">

              <h2><a href="post7.html">Mangrove Forest Koh Kong</a></h2>
              <p>The mangrove forests of Cambodia are environmentally important, providing homes to hundreds of species of wildlife, including, it's said, the famous Irrawaddy dolphins, a pug-nosed species related to the killer whale which are endangered due to the destruction of their natural habitat. (The dolphins are often visited by tourists in their habitat 20 km outside the Cambodian town of Kratie.)Koh Kong province's mangrove forests have been deteriorating since 1979, when the Khmer Rouge were overthrown. At that time, Koh Kong was sparsely populated, and many of the newly displaced Cambodian population chose to make Koh Kong home.Seven or eight kilometres outside of Koh Kong city, or Krong Koh Kong, in Cambodia is an enormous mangrove forest where visitors can observe the delicate ecosystem. </p>

              <p>The Kravanh Mountains, literally the is a mountain range in the south west of Cambodia and Eastern Thailand. The silhouette of the Cardamom Mountains appears in the provincial seal of Trat Province in Thailand.The mountains contain many 15th-17th century AD sites containing 60 cm exotic ceramic jars and rough hewn log coffins set out on remote, natural rock ledges, which are scattered around the mountains[4] The jar burials are a unique feature of the mountain, and are a previously unrecorded burial practice in Khmer cultural history. Local legends suggest the bones are the remains of Cambodian royalty.This range of mountains formed one of the last strongholds of the Khmer Rouge, and many parts are largely inaccessible. The inaccessibility of the hills, however, helped to preserve the area.</p><a class="post-card__avatar8" href="post8.html">

              <p>Bokor Hill is located 42 km from the provincial town. It was erected by French colonists in 1922 during the reign of King Sisowath. Bokor was a resort location for affluent French colonists who needed a change of atmosphere.The Bokor Hill is 1,075 meters high, and promises good weather and magnificent views. Big trees casting shadows over the water and rocks shaped as animal figures hold particular interest for tourists. The mountain overlooks Kampot Town, Kep Beach, Preah Sihanouk Province and blue sea water.This is the main attraction in and around Kampot. Unfortunately at the time of writing it is largely closed to visitors as the road is being repaired. Bokor hill station was built by the French as a high-altitude complement to the fashionable seaside resort of Kep across the bay. Both are now faded and crumbling in a very atmospheric fashion.</p><a class="post-card__avatar9" href="post9.html">
